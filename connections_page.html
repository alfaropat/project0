        <h1 id="main_header">Connections Between Music and Dance</h1>

        <p>
            Given the definitions that can be formulated for music and dance, it can
            be seen that music and dance complement each other. One could even say 
            music cannot exist without dance, and viceversa. Consider the following 
            comparisions that can be made between music and dance:
        </p>
        
        <table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
            <tr>
                <th>Music</th>
                <th>Both</th>
                <th>Dance</th>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>Expresses emotion through sound</td>
                <td>Have their own rhythm</td>
                <td>Expresses emotion through physical movements</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>Tells a story through the different tonalities of a melody</td>
                <td>Expresses a form of emotion</td>
                <td>Tells a story through body movements and expressions</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>Can be a tune, an abrupt sound, or even silence</td>
                <td>Tell a story</td>
                <td>Can be a dance step, a daily action, or even not moving at all</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td></td>
                <td>Are present in our daily lives</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td></td>
                <td>Have a purpose</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td></td>
                <td>Have a connection to memory</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            These comparisons can be further elaborated as follows:
        </p>

        <ol class="compare">
            <li>Music and dance have their own rhythm</li>
                <p>
                    Music can have its own tempo. A melody can either express an ordered tempo 
                    or a disordered tempo. And in either case, this can be seen as music, especially 
                    if one considers the composer's wish of how he wants to express a certain feeling 
                    or concept.
                    
                    </br></br>

                    This concept also applies to music, given that a dancer may either dance at a certain 
                    rhythm or may opt out of doing so because of the given choreography.

                    </br></br>

                    Now consieer the concept of both at the same time: a melody may consist of an ordered 
                    rhythm and the dancer can decide on whether or not to follow the song's rhythm. Likewise, 
                    a melody may show a disordered trend in it's rhythm, and the dancer can decide whether 
                    to dance in tune with the melody or not at all.

                </p>

            <li>Music and dance express a form of emotion</li>
                <p>
                    Music tends to have melodies with changing tonalities, and these tonalities 
                    can show emotions such as happiness, sadness, distress, anger, and so on.

                    </br></br>

                    Dance has movements that, combined with facial expressions, can lead to 
                    the showing of emotions through visible actions.

                    </br></br>

                    By combining both elements, the music can express a sentiment while the dancer 
                    tries to amplify the music's sentiment in their own way.

                </p>

            <li>Music and dance tell a story</li>
                <p>
                    Consider instrumental music playing in a music performance: the musicians 
                    can play an extensive piece that can tell the tale that the listener 
                    can imagine in their minds. 

                    </br></br>

                    Now consider a dance performance: there are dancers that perform choreographies 
                    that tell a tale throught dance moves and expressions.
                    
                    </br></br>

                    Combining both aspects leads to both music and dance complimenting each other: as 
                    the music plays, the dance being performed shows the viewer a tale that is 
                    visibly seen on stage while the music gives off the mood of the tale.
                </p>

            <li>Music and dance are present in our daily lives</li>
                <p>
                    Consider the following motions: a ballet move, walking down a hallway, and standing still.

                </br></br>

                    A ballet move is already considered part of a dance, and 
                    something as simple as walking or standing still can be part 
                    of a dance choreography as well. But have you considered the simple 
                    motion of walking, or even action of standing still, being a part of 
                    the choreography that we all live day by day? This "choreography of 
                    daily life" can lead to believe that life itself is a dance.
                
                </br></br>

                    Now consider the following sounds: a song playing on the radio, the sound of a simple tap,
                    and silence.

                </br></br>

                    When a song plays on the radio, this is already considered music by the listener. And 
                    a simple tap can be seen as music, especially if the tap is given a certain tempo and rhythm. 
                    But what about silence? Silence is usually present in music during certain portions of the 
                    melody, so why not consider silence itself a type of music?
                    
                </p>

            <li>Music and dance have a purpose</li>
                <p>
                    Around the world, people from different parts of the world can have different 
                    reasons for the use of music and dance. Dance and music can be seen in: cultural events, 
                    religion, concert performance, and even during important moments in life.

                    </br></br>

                    For instance: consider a birthday party. There is fun music and dancing during the festivities. 
                    And when it's time to sing the birthday song, there is music because of the singing guests and 
                    maybe even some dancing because some guests may want to move along with the happy tune.

                </p>

            <li>Music and dance have a connection to memory</li>
                <p>
                    Memory is a powerful thing, especially when it comes to music and dance. 
                    Music can assist in a person's recollection to certain memories, usually because 
                    the melody was part of that memory and the memory had an emotional impact on this person. 
                    Thus, every time the song plays, the person that had the particular memory will recall 
                    that moment due to the emotional and musical connection. 

                    </br></br>

                    Dance, on the other hand, works with muscle memory as well. As a discipline, dance 
                    requires practice and dedication. And because a dancer practices their movements diligently, 
                    muscle memory is created. This can be seen more clearly through performing a choreography: 
                    a dancer can practice the choreography in order to perfect the movements prior to the day 
                    of the performance. And even after the performance day passes, the dancer can recall the choreography's 
                    movements with ease. Additionally, if years pass, and maybe the dancer does not recall all of the dance's 
                    movements, the dancer will still recall the dance as something that impacted a part of their life; the 
                    actual choreography may not be fully present, but the memory will remain.
                
                    </br></br>

                    Now consider a combination of both music and dance: a dancer, for instance, can recall the music for a 
                    choreography, which then follows the recollection of the dance that goes along with the tune. In this case, 
                    music is connected to the dance that is connected to a certain memory.

                    </br></br>
