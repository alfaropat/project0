                            I have been dancing since I was three years old, and ever since then I have loved dance. I started off with ballet, 
                            and then I continued on with jazz as well. And during my years as an undergraduate, I decided to have the goal that 
                            alligned with this passion: I wanted to obtain a minor in Dance. This dance minor mainly consisted of modern dance 
                            by using the Martha Graham Technique, which was a new technique that I was eager to learn about.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                            Due to these experiences, I am able to see dance in my daily life, whether through a choreography or a simple action. 
                            I especially see this in my own actions: my regular movements tend to be more graceful and there are times that I 
                            cannot help but do a dance move for fun. And whenever I listen to music, I cannot help but dance to it! An idea for 
                            a choreography can come to my mind, especially if the music has a good rhythm.

                            When I was around nine to ten years old, I started taking piano lessons, which in turn made me open a door 
                            to the creation and love for music. I still recall learning one particular piece: FÃ¼r Elise. The song portrayed 
                            sadness, joy, and anger, and I find it amazing how so many emotions are expressed in one song. And the best part 
                            about playing the song is that I can try to interpret the composer's emotions in my own style. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                            Now that I am no longer taking classes, I play piano on my own free time. I learn songs that I enjoy listening 
                            to, whether by reading a music sheet, trying to play the song by ear, or just writing my own music. I even try 
                            to improvise at times to see if I can make medleys out of the songs that I play. And sometimes, I enjoy going 
                            back to pieces that I used to play in order to reminisce past memories, experiences, and emotions.

                            Both music and dance have impacted my life greatly. I feel that they are experiences that have shaped me 
                            as an individual. Whenever I think of dance, I think about the freedom and emotions that I feel when dancing and the 
                            endless possibilities that I have when making a choreography. And whenever I think of music, I think about 
                            the emotions that I pour into my music and the infinite possible combinations of notes that I can do to make a piece 
                            sound even more beautiful. In the end, I know that music and dance will always have a special place in my heart because 
                            they are passions that I pursue with emotion and joy. And I would not have it any other way.
