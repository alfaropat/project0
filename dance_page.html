        <p>
            What is dance? There are many ways to define this concept, and these
            definitions may even include descriptions that are not as apparent
            unless thought upon.
        </p>

        <p>Dance...</p>

        <ul style="font-size: 18px; margin-left: 70px ">
            <li>tells a story</li>
            <li>lets the dancer express themselves freely</li>
            <li>is done with a purpose</li>
            <li>is present in our daily lives</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This list can continue infinitely, especially since everyone has their
            own definition of dance.
