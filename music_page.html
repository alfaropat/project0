        <p>
            What is music? One could easily say that music is the rhythmic 
            sound that people listen to throught the day, like on the radio
            or through other medias. But have you ever considered simple 
            yet non-rhytmic noises, or even the silence that can be present
            from time to time?

            Music...
        </p>

        <ul style="margin-left: 70px; font-size: 18px;">
            <li>Can tell a story</li>
            <li>Allows the musician to express their feelings through sound</li>
            <li>Has a reason</li>
            <li>Is present in our daily lives</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This list can continue endlessly, given that everyone can have their own definition of music.
